Once upon a time


There was a wizard who wanted to 


Climb mount kilimanjaro and 


kill the kraken lurking in the ocean


On his way he met the Beast of Gevaudan


and using what was taught to him by the hairy dwarfs of Atlantis



He wanted to battle with a Samari 



That's what Linus Torvald taught me 



Witches are just meant to be magical beings 


had ended up electrocuting the village 


He saw the talking Shamanu


and took a selfie with it



And that's why you don't give a wizard a toaster 

The end.
